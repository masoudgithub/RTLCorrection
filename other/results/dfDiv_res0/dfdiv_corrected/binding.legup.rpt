Solving Bipartite Weighted Matching (minimize weights)...
Assignment matrix after operation/function unit matching:
                                                  main_signed_add_32_0          main_signed_add_32_1          
  %265 = add nsw i32 %264, %ma... (idx: 0)        1                             0                             
Checking that every operator was assigned to a functional unit...yes
Binding operator -> functional unit assignments:
  %265 = add nsw i32 %264, %ma... (idx: 0) -> main_signed_add_32_0 (mux inputs: 20)
